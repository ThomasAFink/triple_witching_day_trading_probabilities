# Triple Witching Trading Probabilities

This Jupyter Notebook code provides a comprehensive analysis of the S&P 500 Index returns following the Triple Witching Days (TWD) since 1990.

### What is Triple Witching?

Triple Witching refers to the quarterly event in financial markets where stock index futures, stock index options, and stock options all expire on the same day. This event occurs on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and is associated with increased trading volume and volatility. The significance of studying the returns after TWD is to understand if any predictable price patterns emerge as a result of this event.

### Observations:

The market tends to have a negative average return in the weeks following the Triple Witching Days, with the third week after TWD seeing the most significant drop of about −0.92%

The volatility (standard deviation) increases with each subsequent week after the TWD which is expected because price changes more over time.
The probability of the market ending positively is lowest in the first week after TWD (only 29.81% and highest in the fourth week (58.33%

Conversely, the probability of the market ending negatively is highest in the first week after TWD (70.19%) and lowest in the fourth week (41.67%).

This analysis provides insights into the market behavior following the Triple Witching Days. It's essential to keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results, but understanding these patterns can be helpful for investors and traders.
